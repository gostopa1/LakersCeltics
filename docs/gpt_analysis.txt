Perfect — this directory is the DOS installation folder for Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs.
Those short, extensionless filenames are a hallmark of EA Sports’ early EA-DOS engine, where each file stores one kind of data (rosters, options, commentary, sprites, etc.).

Here’s what each file most likely does (based on known patterns in Lakers vs. Celtics, Jordan vs. Bird, and early NBA Live DOS versions).

🏀 Core executable
File	Likely purpose	Notes
nba.exe	Main program executable	Contains the game logic, rendering engine, RNG, and code that reads the data files. This is the file you’d patch or analyze to find scoring formulas.
🧠 Configuration and options
File	Likely purpose	Notes
optdat	Game options data	Stores menu selections (difficulty, quarter length, control type). Usually a small binary config saved between runs.
opt	Options code or template	The “default” option set loaded when no optdat exists.
tsav	Team save / season state	Very small (139 B), probably last used team or tournament progression.
🕹 Gameplay / match data
File	Likely purpose	Notes
logdat	Log of recent games	Stores scores, highlights, or “last game” info for the replay screen.
rep / repdat	Replay data	Contains recorded replays or highlight clips (frame-by-frame input logs).
sub / subdat	Substitution patterns	Defines lineups, player rotations, and fatigue thresholds.
smndat	Sound manager data	Holds pointers to sound/music effects.
v / vic	Victory / ending sequences	“Victory” text, animation pointers, credits.
📋 Rosters & teams
File	Likely purpose	Notes
lct	Lakers–Celtics Teams data	The big one for you — 51 KB, consistent with roster tables, player ratings, and team attributes. Probably stores all player names and stats.
t	Team index	Smaller 2–3 KB file referencing tp0–tp9; likely a lookup table of team records (IDs → file names).
tp0 → tp9	Team player files	Ten team roster files. Each ~5 KB → roughly one per team (5 KB ≈ 10 players × ~500 bytes). Inside you’ll likely find player names and stats.
tre	Team references	4.8 KB — possibly a short index tying teams to graphics/colors/logos.
ttl	Title data	Title screen text (team list, copyright strings, etc.).
sel	Team selection screen data	Defines the team-selection graphics and color palettes.
🖼 Graphics, animation & sound
File	Likely purpose	Notes
a / c / m / o / p / r / s / v	Graphics / sprites / fonts	Each small (2–25 KB). Early EA titles split art assets into tiny lumps:
• a = arena graphics or audience
• c = court (floor, colors)
• m = menus
• o = overlays
• p = portraits or player sprites
• r = referees / rim / scoreboard graphics
• s = sound effect index or sprite sheet
• v = victory animations (shared with vic).
tre / ttl / sel	As above, selection/title screen assets.	
🏁 What matters for your research (player probabilities)

The roster data is almost certainly inside lct and/or tp0–tp9.
These are the files you’ll want to inspect first with strings or xxd. You should find player names (like “MAGIC”, “BIRD”, “KAREEM”) inside one of them.

A good order to check:

strings lct | egrep -i "MAGIC|BIRD|KAREEM|JORDAN|LAKERS|CELTICS"
strings tp0 | head


If you see names, that file holds the player attribute tables we discussed earlier — meaning you can start locating ratings and, later, deduce the scoring probability weights from there.

Would you like me to show the exact next commands to extract readable player names and locate the attribute tables inside lct or tp*? (I can tailor the command lines for macOS since your prompt shows “staff / tan”.)
